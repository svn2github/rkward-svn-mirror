  abstract = {Summary: With the establishment of high-throughput (HT) screening
	methods there is an increasing need for automatic analysis methods.
	Here we present RReportGenerator, a user-friendly portal for automatic
	routine analysis using the statistical platform R and Bioconductor.
	RReportGenerator is designed to analyze data using predefined analysis
	scenarios via a graphical user interface (GUI). A report in pdf format
	combining text, figures and tables is auto- matically generated and
	results may be exported. To demonstrate suitable analysis tasks we
	provide direct web access to a collection of analysis scenarios for
	summarizing data from transfected cell arrays (TCA), segmentation
	of CGH data, and microarray quality control and normalization. Availability:
	RReportGenerator, a user manual and a collection of analysis scenarios
	are available under a GNU public license on http://www-bio3d-igbmc.u-strasbg.fr/~wraff},

  review = {Software usage by end-users is one of the factors used to evaluate
	the success of software projects. In the context of open source software,
	there is no single and non-controversial measure of usage, though.
	Still, one of the most used and readily available measure is data
	about projects downloads. Nevertheless, download counts and averages
	do not convey as much information as the patterns in the original
	downloads time series. In this research, we propose a method to increase
	the expressiveness of mere download rates by considering download
	patterns against software releases. We apply experimentally our method
	to the most downloaded projects of SourceForge’s history crawled
	through the FLOSSMole repository. Findings show that projects with
	similar usage can have indeed different levels of sensitivity to
	releases, revealing different behaviors of users. Future research
	will develop further the pattern recognition approach to automatically
	categorize open source projects according to their download patterns.},
