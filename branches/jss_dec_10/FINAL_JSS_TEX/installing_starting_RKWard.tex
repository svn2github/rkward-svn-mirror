\label{sec:installing_starting_RKWard}
\pkg{RKWard} can be downloaded free of charge in source and binary form from \url{http://rkward.sourceforge.net/}. 
On the GNU/Linux platform, binary packages are available for many major distributions,
including Debian, Ubuntu, OpenSuse, Gentoo, and Fedora. On the Microsoft Windows
platform, \pkg{RKWard} is available in two forms: as a single binary
installer (requires existing installations of
\proglang{R} and \pkg{RKWard}) and
as an installation bundle (including \proglang{R} and
essential parts of the \pkg{KDE} runtime environment)\footnote{For detailed information please refer to the 
\pkg{RKWard} wiki \url{http://p.sf.net/rkward/windows}.}. At the time of
this writing, the developers lack the resources to support a Mac OS X
port, and especially to provide binaries for Mac OS X. However, \pkg{RKWard}
has been shown to be compilable and installable on the Mac, and appears
to be mostly functional.

\pkg{RKWard} cannot be loaded from within an \proglang{R}
session, but rather it is started as a stand-alone application with an
embedded \proglang{R} engine. To facilitate the first
steps for new users, a dialog offers the choice to load an existing
workspace, to start with an empty workspace, or to create a new
\code{data.frame} and open that for editing. Also, an overview help page is
shown in the document area of the main window. Both start-up features
can be turned off.
