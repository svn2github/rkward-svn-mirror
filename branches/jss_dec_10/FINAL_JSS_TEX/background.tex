\section{Background and motivation}
\label{background}
In mid 1993 Ihaka and Gentleman published initial efforts on the computing
language and programming environment \proglang{R} on the \emph{s-news} mailing list. Ambitions for
this project were to develop an \proglang{S}-like language without inheriting memory
and performance issues. The source code of \proglang{R} was finally released in 1995, and 
since 1997 development has evolved under the umbrella of the \proglang{R} 
Development Core Team \citep{RDCT2001, RDCT2010, Ihaka_Gentlemen_1993}.
\proglang{R} does not include an advanced cross-platform GUI (graphical user interface) as known from other
statistical software packages. However, \proglang{R} includes tools for building GUIs
mainly based on \proglang{Tlc/Tk} \citep{Dalgaard2001, Dalgaard2002}. Meanwhile a
plethora of \proglang{R} GUIs have emerged (see \url{http://www.sciviews.org/_rgui/} for a
comprehensive list). In 2005 John Fox released version 1.0 of \proglang{R} Commander (package \pkg{Rcmdr}), which
can be considered a milestone in \proglang{R} GUI development; it was the first GUI
implementation that was able to make statistical tests,
plots and data manipulation easily accessible for \proglang{R} novices.
John Fox stated that \pkg{Rcmdr}'s target was to provide
functionality for basic-statistical courses, though the features have increased over
time beyond this \citep{Fox2005, Fox2007}. In November 2002 Thomas Friedrichsmeier
started the RKWard open-source software project with the goal to create a GUI for
\proglang{R} based on \proglang{KDE} and \proglang{Qt} technologies.

The scope of RKWard is deliberately broad, targeting both \proglang{R} novices and experts.
For the first group, the aim is to allow any person with knowledge on
statistical procedures to start using RKWard for their everyday work 
without having to learn anything about the \proglang{R} programming language,
at least initially. At the same time, RKWard tries to support users who want to learn and
exploit the full flexibility of the \proglang{R} language for automating or customizing
an analysis. At the other end of the learning curve, RKWard provides advanced IDE (integrated development environment)
features to \proglang{R} experts to assist in writing \proglang{R} scripts. Yet, the idea
is that \proglang{R} experts too will benefit from the availability of task-oriented GUI
dialogs, such as when exploring an unfamiliar type of analysis
or by allowing to implement routinely performed tasks as a GUI element. In
addition, many features like the integrated data editor and the plot preview 
will be useful to \proglang{R} novices and \proglang{R} experts alike in their everyday work
(see Section~\ref{sec:user_interface}).

RKWard provides a high level of transparency about the steps that are needed to
perform any supported task in \proglang{R}, in order to make it easy for the user to see
complete codes for all GUI actions\footnote{
  This distinguishes RKWard from \proglang{R} GUIs such as Red-R (\url{http://www.red-r.org/}), which 
  specifically aims to hide the complexities of the \proglang{R} programming language, following the concept of visual data-flow 
  programming \citep{Sutherland1966}. In contrast, RKWard limits itself to generate \proglang{R} code from GUI settings.
}. In doing so, RKWard deliberately generates
comparatively verbose code. It avoids wrapping complex sequences of data
manipulation or analysis into custom high-level \proglang{R} functions. The task of
providing high-level functions is logically independent of the development of the
GUI frontend, and should best be addressed in dedicated \proglang{R} packages, where necessary.
This approach allows to make better use of the modular design of \proglang{R}, avoids
locking-in users to a specific GUI application, and provides them with more options for
customizing the generated code patterns.

While RKWard tries to address users wishing to learn \proglang{R}, it is specifically not
designed as a teaching tool (such as \pkg{Rcmdr} or \pkg{TeachingDemos}), but as
a productive tool. Dialogs for statistical procedures in RKWard do not
necessarily show a one-to-one correspondence to the underlying steps in \proglang{R}, but are
rather oriented at statistical tasks. Furthermore, RKWard does not impose
artificial limitations on how users can work with the application. For example,
the user is not limited to using only one \code{data.frame} or one model at a
time. RKWard is designed to allow users to create custom GUI dialogs
easily (see Sections~\ref{sec:technical_plugins} and \ref{sec:example_plugin}).

RKWard is licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL (general public license) Version 2
or higher. However, due to its dependencies, RKWard binaries are effectively
distributable only under the terms of the GPL Version 2. Parts of the documentation are
GFDL (GNU free documentation license) licensed. While the project remains in constant development, a growing
number of users employs RKWard in productive scenarios. The source code,
selected binaries and documentation is hosted at SourceForge
(\url{http://rkward.sourceforge.net/}). Selected key milestones of the development of RKWard are
visualized in Figure~\ref{fig:timeline}.

In this paper we will first give an overview over the main GUI elements and
features of RKWard (Section~\ref{sec:user_interface}), followed by a short example 
of a simple RKWard session (Section~\ref{sec:using_RKWard}). Next, technical 
details of the implementation will be discussed, comparing them briefly to 
competing GUI solutions, where appropriate (Section~\ref{sec:technical}).
Finally, we show an example for creating a plugin extension to RKWard 
(Section~\ref{sec:example_plugin}).
