\Abstract{
\pkg{RKWard} is a GUI to \proglang{R} with the objective to provide a 
portable and extensible \proglang{R} interface for both
basic and advanced statistical and graphical analysis. This supplement discusses 
in detail technical aspects of \pkg{RKWard} including the usage of the \pkg{KDE}/\pkg{Qt} software libraries which are the base of \pkg{RKWard}.
Statistical procedures and plots are implemented as an extendable plugin architecture in \pkg{RKWard}. 
This plugin architechture is based on \proglang{ECMAScript} (\proglang{JavaScript}), \proglang{R}, and XML. The general 
design is described and its application is exemplified on a Student's $t$~test.
