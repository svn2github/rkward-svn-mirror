   TODO list for the revision (Incomplete!)

- Update screenshots:
Figure number   |   Importance   |   Comments
2                   high             no more Pending Jobs tool view, toolbar changed, status bar changed, could show an S4 object in workspace browser (DONE)
3                   very low         reduced size (no purpose in showing workspace browser, etc., here. (DONE)
5                   high             see Figure 2. Should probably uncheck "Show all Environments" (DONE)
8                   medium           minimally improved default CSS. Should include short snippet of syntax highlighted commands / console transcript (DONE)
10                  high             no longer shows ".GlobalEnv" (addresses reviewer comment) (DONE)
11                  high             see Figure 8. At least this one is very easy to re-create (DONE)

- Re-do figure placement, after everything else is done!

#----------------------------------------------------------

Updates we did to reflect changes in the released version of RKWard (now 0.5.6, instead of 0.5.4)
* Section "Code editor":         We point out that users can define custom actions in Kate based on ECMAScript (since KDE 4.6)
* Section "Results output":      R code and R output can now be copied to the output window, easily. Figure 8 was extended to show this,
                                 and a short paragraph was added to the end of the "Results output" section.
* Section "Futher tool windows": Point out that the "Pending jobs" window is not (any longer) shown by default.
* Supplement, section "Asynchronous command execution": Frontend and backend are now running in separate processes, instead of separate threads.
* Supplement, section "Asynchronous command execution": The process of gathering object information is somewhat less pro-active, now, and also
                                 includes S4 slots, and package namespaces.
* Supplement, section "Development process": External plugins, which are not an official part of RKWard, can now be directly downloaded and installed by chosing them from a GUI dialog.
Further, Figures, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, and 11 were updated to reflect changes in the GUI.

Assorted other aspects that we improved (not specifically requested by the reviewer)

* In our paper we claimed that RKWard is aimed as productive too. We added citations, including one of the first author, from peer-review literature which specifically cite the usage of RKWard during their research work as support for our claim that RKWard's purpose is the usage as a productive tool.
* We updated the example script (demo.R) to reflect the changes requested by the reviewers. We also added a reference for reader to the zip-archive containing all scripts and data used in the paper. 
  - TF: I wonder whether that really makes sense, as including examples is really standard in JStatSoft. I checked some other recent articles, and those
    do not seem to mention the examples, specifically.
    Besides, in our case, I think that having the code examples is comparatively pointless (except perhaps for the example plugin), since most of
    that is simply to show off GUI features, not produce anything.
    Or perhaps, point to the demo-script, once, at the first applicable point in the text, only.

Issues raised by the reviewers

DONE

* We incorporated fixes to grammar and orthographical errors as suggested by the reviewers.
* We added specifically citation of the data set sources used in our figures.
* The first submitted paper (JSS 706) was splitted in a main paper focusing on GUI related features of RKWard and an annex which in detail describes the technologies that RKWard is based on. This resulted in circa XY% reduction in length.
  - In the section "Background and motivation", we added a mostly non-technical paragraph on the plugin framework, since we consider extensibility
    using plugins a central feature. All technical details have been moved to the supplement.
* As suggested by the second reviewer, we have added slightly more details and citations in our footnotes on the KDE and Qt technologies.
* The first reviewer's criticism that all workspace views show an item ".GlobalEnv" to the user has been addressed in RKWard 0.5.6. Now this item
  is hidden, when .GlobalEnv is the only environment shown, but remains visible, when all environments on the serach path are presented. This did
  not result in any changes of the text, but Figures 5, 10, and 11 were updated, accordingly. Figure 3 was cropped to save space, and does not
  show the workspace browser, any longer.
* As suggested by the editors, we have significantly expanded our description of the installation process, specifically addressing the availability
  of RKWard and its dependencies on the different platforms (Section "Installation and platform availability"). We feel that this discussion should
  also help alleviate the concerns that the first reviewer has voiced about using KDE as a platform.
* We have removed the term "cross-platform" from the abstract, and from the list of keywords.
* In the supplement's section "On-screen graphics windows", we have added a proper citation for the lattice package, as requested by the second
  reviewer.
* We replaced the Unix-specific path "~/.rkward" by a paraphrase which is also correct on Windows (second reviewer).
* The first reviewer asked for more information about the M/T/S/DI GUI approach. We added remarks and references on this issue.

Stuff that we will not address in the article, but that we need to respond to:
- First reviewer:
  * KDE as an "emulation" -> Explain that it is not an emulation, not even on the Mac.
    Show that the KDE dependency may be "heavy", but not really a problem on Windows.
    Concede that we are not in good shape and the Mac, and that we now state that in the article, cleary.
    Point to section "Choice of toolkit...", which already explains some core reasons, why we use KDE. Perhaps also link to the dot.kde.org interview.

-----

- In what form will we present the above revision notes? Probably by citing the reviewers comments, and adding our responses in between?
