TODO list for the revision (Incomplete!)

Updated screenshots:
Figure number   |   Importance   |   Comments
2                   high             no more Pending Jobs tool view, toolbar changed, status bar changed, could show an S4 object in workspace browser
3                   very low         could hide ".GlobalEnv", here
5                   high             see Figure 2. Should probably uncheck "Show all Environments"
8                   medium           minimally improved default CSS. Should include short snippet of syntax highlighted commands / console transcript
10                  high             no longer shows ".GlobalEnv" (addresses reviewer comment)
11                  high             see Figure 8. At least this one is very easy to re-create
