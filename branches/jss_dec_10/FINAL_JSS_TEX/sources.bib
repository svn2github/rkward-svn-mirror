  review = {Software usage by end-users is one of the factors used to evaluate the success of software projects. In the context of open source software, there is no single and non-controversial measure of usage, though. Still, one of the most used and readily available measure is data about projects downloads. Nevertheless, download counts and averages do not convey as much information as the patterns in the original downloads time series. In this research, we propose a method to increase the expressiveness of mere download rates by considering download patterns against software releases. We apply experimentally our method to the most downloaded projects of SourceForge’s history crawled through the FLOSSMole repository. Findings show that projects with similar usage can have indeed different levels of sensitivity to releases, revealing different behaviors of users. Future research will develop further the pattern recognition approach to automatically categorize open source projects according to their download patterns.},

  title = {Multi-Platform Document-Oriented GUIs},
  year = {2010},
  abstract = {In recent years, increasing complexity of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) of applications has led to problems in GUI management, since there is no single layout to fulfill every user’s needs. GUI editors have been developed to enhance end-user options but they commonly fail to preserve personalized GUIs. This paper presents an extension to the GUI editor built into the Auckland Layout Model (ALM) that can permanently store user-defined GUI layouts and reproduce them on different platforms. A novel technique called the document-oriented approach has been exploited to empower end-user customization, which allows GUI layouts to be dynamically edited, saved using a standardized XML-based GUI description language, and loaded in a platform-independent manner.},

  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},

  volume = {10},
  pages = {74},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND:R is the leading open source statistics software with a vast number of biostatistical and bioinformatical analysis packages. To exploit the advantages of R, extensive scripting/programming skills are required.RESULTS:We have developed a software tool called R GUI Generator (RGG) which enables the easy generation of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) for the programming language R by adding a few Extensible Markup Language (XML) - tags. RGG consists of an XML-based GUI definition language and a Java-based GUI engine. GUIs are generated in runtime from defined GUI tags that are embedded into the R script. User-GUI input is returned to the R code and replaces the XML-tags. RGG files can be developed using any text editor. The current version of RGG is available as a stand-alone software (RGGRunner) and as a plug-in for JGR.CONCLUSION:RGG is a general GUI framework for R that has the potential to introduce R statistics (R packages, built-in functions and scripts) to users with limited programming skills and helps to bridge the gap between R developers and GUI-dependent users. RGG aims to abstract the GUI development from individual GUI toolkits by using an XML-based GUI definition language. Thus RGG can be easily integrated in any software. The RGG project further includes the development of a web-based repository for RGG-GUIs. RGG is an open source project licensed under the Lesser General Public License (LGPL) and can be downloaded freely at http://rgg.r-forge.r-project.org},

abstract ={Summary: With the establishment of high-throughput (HT) screening methods there is an increasing need for automatic analysis methods. Here we present RReportGenerator, a user-friendly portal for automatic routine analysis using the statistical platform R and Bioconductor. RReportGenerator is designed to analyze data using predefined analysis scenarios via a graphical user interface (GUI). A report in pdf format combining text, figures and tables is automatically generated and results may be exported. To demonstrate suitable analysis tasks we provide direct web access to a collection of analysis scenarios for summarizing data from transfected cell arrays (TCA), segmentation of CGH data, and microarray quality control and normalization.Availability: RReportGenerator, a user manual and a collection of analysis scenarios are available under a GNU public license on http://www-bio3d-igbmc.u-strasbg.fr/~wraffContact: wolfgang.raffelsberger@igbmc.u-strasbg.fr},
