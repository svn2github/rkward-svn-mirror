\Abstract{
  \proglang{R} is a free open-source implementation of the \proglang{S} statistical computing
language and programming environment. The current status of \proglang{R} is a
command line driven interface with no advanced cross-platform graphical user
interface (GUI), but it includes tools for building such. Over the past
years, proprietary and non-proprietary GUI solutions have emerged, 
based on internal or external tool kits, with different scopes and technological concepts.
For example, \proglang{Rgui.exe} and \proglang{Rgui.app} have
become the de facto GUI on the Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X platforms, respectively, for most users. 
In this paper we discuss \pkg{RKWard} which aims to be both a
comprehensive cross-platform GUI and an integrated development environment 
for \proglang{R}. \pkg{RKWard} is based on the \pkg{KDE} software libraries. Statistical
procedures and plots are implemented using an extendable plugin
architecture based on \proglang{ECMAScript} (\proglang{JavaScript}), \proglang{R}, and XML. \pkg{RKWard}
provides an excellent tool to manage different types of data objects;
even allowing for seamless editing of certain types. The objective of
\pkg{RKWard} is to provide a portable and extensible \proglang{R} interface for both
basic and advanced statistical and graphical analysis, while not
compromising on flexibility and modularity of the \proglang{R} programming
environment itself.
