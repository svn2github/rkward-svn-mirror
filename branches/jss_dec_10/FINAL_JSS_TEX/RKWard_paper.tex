\Abstract{
  R is a free, open-source implementation of the S statistical computing
language and programming environment. The current status of R is a
command line driven interface with no advanced standard Graphical User
Interface (GUI) but it includes tools for building such. Over the past
years proprietary and non-proprietary GUI solutions, based on internal
or external tool kits, with different scopes and technological concepts
have emerged. In this paper we discuss RKWard which aims to be both a
comprehensive cross-platform GUI and Integrated Development Environment
(IDE) for R. RKWard is based on the KDE software libraries. Statistical
procedures and plots are implemented using an extendable plugin
architecture based on ECMA script (JavaScript), R, and XML. RKWard
provides an excellent tool to manage different types of data objects;
even allowing for seamless editing of certain types. The objective of
RKWard is to provide a portable and extensible R interface for both
basic and advanced statistical and graphical analysis while not
compromising on flexibility and modularity of the R programming
environment itself.
