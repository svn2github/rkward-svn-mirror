\Abstract{
  \proglang{R} is a free, open-source implementation of the \proglang{S} statistical computing
language and programming environment. The current status of \proglang{R} is a
command line driven interface with no advanced standard Graphical User
Interface (GUI) but it includes tools for building such. Over the past
years proprietary and non-proprietary GUI solutions, based on internal
or external tool kits, with different scopes and technological concepts
have emerged. In this paper we discuss RKWard which aims to be both a
comprehensive cross-platform GUI and Integrated Development Environment
(IDE) for \proglang{R}. RKWard is based on the \proglang{KDE} software libraries. Statistical
procedures and plots are implemented using an extendable plugin
architecture based on \proglang{ECMAScript} (\proglang{JavaScript}), \proglang{R}, and \proglang{XML}. RKWard
provides an excellent tool to manage different types of data objects;
even allowing for seamless editing of certain types. The objective of
RKWard is to provide a portable and extensible \proglang{R} interface for both
basic and advanced statistical and graphical analysis while not
compromising on flexibility and modularity of the \proglang{R} programming
environment itself.
