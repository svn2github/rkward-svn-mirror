\section{Conclusion and outlook}
\label{sec:conclusion_summary}
In this article we have introduced the RKWard GUI to \proglang{R}. RKWard provides features ranging
from easy to use dialogs for common statistical procedures targetted at \proglang{R} novices, to advanced
IDE features targetted at \proglang{R} experts.

RKWard tries to empower users of all knowledge levels to make more efficient use of the 
\proglang{R} programming language, while carefully avoiding to lock in users to a specific
GUI solution. In particular, RKWard
\begin{itemize}
 \item provides full transparency about the \proglang{R} code that is used to carry out tasks.
 \item avoids introducing RKWard-specific \proglang{R} functions for central functionality (but uses some for output formatting).
 \item avoids hard dependencies on third-party \proglang{R} packages.
 \item uses standard \proglang{R} formats \citep[see][]{RDCT2010c} for data storage, and open standards (\proglang{HTML}, PNG, SVG) for storage of output.
\end{itemize}

Future versions of RKWard will continue to add value for both groups of users. Planned features include
an enhanced interface for debugging \proglang{R} code, support for editing more types of data, and the
ability to connect the RKWard GUI to a remote \proglang{R} engine. Perhaps most importantly, RKWard will
gain many new User Interface dialogs for manipulation, analysis, and visualization of data. The ability to
develop these dialogs as plugins allows to develop and distribute GUI dialogs
independently of the RKWard core application, allowing any user to help in enhancing RKWard, without in-depth
programming knowledge.
