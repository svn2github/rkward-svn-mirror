\section{Conclusion and Summary}
Within this work we introduced RKWard which is both an IDE for
\proglang{R} scripts and a GUI to statistical
procedures commonly used in the process of statistical analysis.

\begin{enumerate}
\item For Desktop
\item Conservative GUI other than data-flow programming (ViSta (called
WorkMap, Young 2004, 2005 (JSS), Red-R or Statistiklabor)
\item Customizable for User needs
\item Further development (GHNS) of plugins for extension of RKWards
functionality
\item We do not focus on \proglang{R} package
development but keep it at the \proglang{R} community.
However, scripts which are routinely in use or require complex steps
can be converted to GUI elements in RKWard.
\item Plugin structure independent development (not compatible with
other \proglang{R} GUI solutions)
\end{enumerate}
