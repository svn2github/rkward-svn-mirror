\section{Conclusion and outlook}
\label{sec:conclusion_summary}
In this article we have introduced the RKWard GUI to \proglang{R}. RKWard provides features ranging
from easy to use dialogs for common statistical procedures, targetted at \proglang{R} novices, to advanced
IDE features targetted at \proglang{R} experts.

Future versions of RKWard will continue to add value for both groups of users. Planned features include
an enhanced interface for debugging \proglang{R} code, support for editing more types of data, and the
ability to connect the RKWard GUI to a remote \proglang{R} engine. Perhaps most importantly, RKWard will
gain many new UI dialogs for manipulation, analysis, and visualization of data. The ability to
develop these dialogs as plugins allows any contributor or user to help in enhancing RKWard, without in-depth
programming knowledge.
