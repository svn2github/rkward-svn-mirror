---- What's left TODO of the specific notes: ----

o Omit the footnotes in the \author{} statement. Instead put the remarks
into the \section*{Acknowledgments}. Give only the main affiliation in
\author{}, further affiliations can be given in the \Address{}.

TODO: Move equal contribution note to Acknowledgments
Done: Affiliation for Stefan

o Formally \cite suitable references for KDE and Qt etc. instead of
just giving URLs in footnotes.

o Include the URLs from Footnotes 4-10, 20-23 into the regular text (e.g.,
in parentheses).

o \pkg{R} -> \proglang{R}. There are also various instances of "R" without
any markup, please correct.

TODO: check again

o Please use three digits for R versions, i.e., 1.3.0 etc.

TODO: check again

o Omit the URLs in the references to standard journal articles. If the
journal is open access (i.e., including JSS, R News etc.) a single URL
or the DOI should be kept.

TODO: check again

--------- What's done (with comments if needed) ---------

o For \cite-ing the R-GUI page of Philippe a formal BibTeX item is
provided below.

o Please use \code{} markup for file names (not sf).

o Tlc -> Tcl

o The .pdf underlying Figure 1 is extremely large and hence delays loading
of the page when reading the paper on screen. Please supply a leaner
.pdf (the text, boxes, and shadings should not require 1M...).

o Please \cite Rcmdr and TeachingDemos. Suitable BibTeX items are provided
below.

o Use \code{} markup for GUI elements, e.g., menu items, buttons, or key
combinations. (You can also use \texttt which may be easier in combination
with arrows.)

o If you keep quotation marks in addition to \code markup for GUI elements,
please make sure that the direction is appropriate. Currently, there are
a few instances where this is not the case (e.g., "Future Options" in
the caption of Figure 6).

o Please use "(A)", "(B)" etc. instead of "A)", "B)" etc.

o Is "RreportGenerator" or "RReportGenerator" correct?

o \pkg{Sweave} -> \code{Sweave} (because it is a function not a package).

o An enhanced Sweave citation is included below.

o UNIX -> Unix

o Use "$t$~test" instead of "t-Test".

Done. However, in an RKWard menu item the spelling t-Test is used, and the spelling was kept for direct references to this particular menu item.

o Omit the doi in the Gentleman et al. reference and the citeseer reference
in Kim and Lutteroth.

o Is there an update on the publication information in Roediger et al. (2011b)
yet? If volume/number/pages are not available yet, a doi can be supplied.
