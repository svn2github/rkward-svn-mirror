  abstract = { Microbead-based assays have evolved into powerful tools for the multiplex
	detection of biomolecules. Analytes are captured by DNA or protein
	capture molecules which are coupled on microbead surfaces. A homogeneous
	carboxylation of microbeads is essential for the optimal and reproducible
	coupling of capture molecules and thus a prerequisite for an optimal
	multiplex microbead-based assay performance. We developed a simple
	fluorescence dye adsorption assay for the description of microbead
	carboxylation and for the prediction of coupling successes of capture
	molecules. Using the fluorescence dye SYTO-62 it is possible to quantify
	the degree of carboxylation of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) microbeads
	within 1 h in a multiplex format by fluorescence microscopy or flow
	cytometry. Compared to conventional bulk assays which only provide
	an average degree of carboxylation the main advantage of the SYTO-62
	assay is the single microbead analysis and therefore the description
	of the qualitative distribution of carboxylation in microbead populations.
	The SYTO-62 assay is sensitive enough to even determine weak carboxylation.
	Also, the quality of microbeads can be evaluated. To our knowledge
	this is the first report which applies a reversible noncovalent fluorescent
	dye adsorption assay to quantify the degree of carboxylation on surfaces.

  abstract = {A unique property of the mammalian embryo is that stem cells can be
	derived from its early tissue lineages. These lineages will give
	rise to the fetus as well as essential extraembryonic tissues. Understanding
	how chromatin regulation participates in establishment of these lineages
	in the embryo and their derived stem cells provides insight that
	will critically inform our understanding of embryogenesis and stem
	cell biology. Here, we compare the genomewide location of active
	and repressive histone modifications in embryonic stem cells, trophoblast
	stem cells, and extraembryonic endoderm stem cells from the mouse.
	Our results show that the active modification H3K4me3 has a similar
	role in the three stem cell types, but the repressive modification
	H3K27me3 varies in abundance and genomewide distribution. Thus, alternative
	mechanisms mediate transcriptional repression in stem cells from
	the embryo. In addition, using carrier chromatin immunoprecipitation
	we show that bivalent histone domains seen in embryonic stem cells
	exist in pluripotent cells of the early embryo. However, the epigenetic
	status of extraembryonic progenitor cells in the embryo did not entirely
	reflect the extraembryonic stem cell lines. These studies indicate
	that histone modification mechanisms may differ between early embryo
	lineages and emphasize the importance of examining in vivo and in
	vitro progenitor cells.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:R is the leading open source statistics software with a
	vast number of biostatistical and bioinformatical analysis packages.
	To exploit the advantages of R, extensive scripting/programming skills
	are required.RESULTS:We have developed a software tool called R GUI
	Generator (RGG) which enables the easy generation of Graphical User
	Interfaces (GUIs) for the programming language R by adding a few
	Extensible Markup Language (XML) - tags. RGG consists of an XML-based
	GUI definition language and a Java-based GUI engine. GUIs are generated
	in runtime from defined GUI tags that are embedded into the R script.
	User-GUI input is returned to the R code and replaces the XML-tags.
	RGG files can be developed using any text editor. The current version
	of RGG is available as a stand-alone software (RGGRunner) and as
	a plug-in for JGR.CONCLUSION:RGG is a general GUI framework for R
	that has the potential to introduce R statistics (R packages, built-in
	functions and scripts) to users with limited programming skills and
	helps to bridge the gap between R developers and GUI-dependent users.
	RGG aims to abstract the GUI development from individual GUI toolkits
	by using an XML-based GUI definition language. Thus RGG can be easily
	integrated in any software. The RGG project further includes the
	development of a web-based repository for RGG-GUIs. RGG is an open
	source project licensed under the Lesser General Public License (LGPL)
	and can be downloaded freely at http://rgg.r-forge.r-project.org}

  abstract = {Abstract Six different clones of 1-year-old loblolly pine (Pinus taeda
	L.) seedlings grown under standardized conditions in a green house
	were used for sample preparation and further analysis. Three independent
	and complementary analytical techniques for metabolic profiling were
	applied in the present study: hydrophilic interaction chromatography
	(HILIC-LC/ESI-MS), reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RP-LC/ESI-MS),
	and gas chromatography all coupled to mass spectrometry (GC/TOF-MS).
	Unsupervised methods, such as principle component analysis (PCA)
	and clustering, and supervised methods, such as classification, were
	used for data mining. Genetic algorithms (GA), a multivariate approach,
	was probed for selection of the smallest subsets of potentially discriminative
	classifiers. From more than 2000 peaks found in total, small subsets
	were selected by GA as highly potential classifiers allowing discrimination
	among six investigated genotypes. Annotated GC/TOF-MS data allowed
	the generation of a small subset of identified metabolites. LC/ESI-MS
	data and small subsets require further annotation. The present study
	demonstrated that combination of comprehensive metabolic profiling
	and advanced data mining techniques provides a powerful metabolomic
	approach for biomarker discovery among small molecules. Utilizing
	GA for feature selection allowed the generation of small subsets
	of potent classifiers. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.}
